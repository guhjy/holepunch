\title{Write a minimal Dockerfile for a Binder}
\usage{
write_dockerfile(
  base = NULL,
  path = ".",
  maintainer = getOption("usethis.full_name"),
  r_date = NULL,
  branch = "master",
  install_github = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{base}{Your Docker base. I recommend that you use a binder base from the
\href{https://www.rocker-project.org/images/}{Rocker project}. This daily
image will contain all the Jupyter hub elements + Rstudio Server + the
Tidyverse (which cuts down on installation time). The only thing then left
to do is to install any additional packages listed in your DESCRIPTION file,
which will be done during the build_binder step.}

\item{path}{path to binder repo. Defaults to current location.}

\item{maintainer}{Maintainer of the Dockerfile. By default the function reads
`usethis.full_name` set in Options. The same information is used to set the
author on your DESCRIPTION file.  For more information on setting up default
values for Description files, read the
\href{https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/usethis-setup.html#store-default-values-for-description-fields-and-other-preferences}{Rstudio
usethis documentation}.}

\item{r_date}{Date you need R to lock down to. By default it picks the most
recent date a file was touched in this project but you can override this by
specifying this explicitly. Date must be in ISO 8601 format, e.g.
2019-06-27}

\item{branch}{Default is master but you can pass other branches}

\item{install_github}{If `TRUE`, it will install all packages listed in Remotes}
}
\description{
The file is written to a hidden folder called `.binder/`. This will not
interfere with other Dockerfiles that you may have in your root to help with
other services like CI.
